These recent events underscore the DART push and cast a shadow over our workflow. However, good workflow has always been an issue in our discipline. Cloud storage services like <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> are still relatively new among political scientists. Without cloud storage, previous workflow left open the possibility that work between a home computer and an office computer was lost as a function of a corrupted thumb drive, an overheated power supply, or, among other things, the wave of viruses that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/05/technology/microsoftbounty/" target="_blank">would particularly affect Microsoft users every summer</a>. Social sciences, <a href="http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/01/23/plain-text/" target="_blank">unlike engineering</a>, have traditionally relied on software like Microsoft Word for manuscript preparation though any word processor reduces workflow to a series of clicks and strokes on a keyboard. This is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/krugman-the-excel-depression.html" target="_blank">a terrible way to track changes</a> or maintain version control. The addition of collaborators only compounds all the aforementioned issues. The proverbial left hand may not know what the right hand is doing.

I think there is reason for optimism. We only struggle with it now because we have tools like <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">R Markdown</a> and <a href="http://pandoc.org/" target="_blank">Pandoc</a>, more generally, that make significant strides in workflow. LaTeX resolved earlier issues of corrupted binary files by reducing documents to raw markup that was little more than raw text and revisions that could be easily kept as <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11177/how-to-write-hidden-notes-in-a-latex-file" target="_blank">"commented" text</a>. However, for all its benefits (including pretty PDFs), [LaTeX is <i>ugly</i> code](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~aty/bibliog/latex/gripe.html) and does not provide means of seamlessly working with the actual data analysis itself. R Markdown both eliminates markup and allows the author and her collaborators to write and reproduce the manuscript in one fell swoop.

<h1>Getting Started with YAML</h1>

The lion's share of a R Markdown document will be raw text, though the front matter may be the most important part of the document. R Markdown uses <a href="http://www.yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a> for its metadata and the fields differ from <a href="http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/02/moving-from-beamer-to-r-markdown/" target="_blank">what an author would use for a Beamer presentation</a>. I provide a sample YAML metadata largely taken from this exact document and explain it below.

<code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">output:</code> will tell R Markdown we want a PDF document rendered with LaTeX. Since we are adding a fair bit of custom options to this call, we specify <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">pdf&#95;document:</code> on the next line (with, importantly, a two-space indent). We specify additional output-level options underneath it, each are indented with four spaces. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">citation&#95;package: natbib</code> tells R Markdown to use <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">natbib</code> to handle bibliographic citations.[^natbib] Thereafter, the next line (<code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">keep&#95;tex: true</code>) tells R Markdown to render a raw <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">.tex</code> file along with the PDF document. This is useful for both debugging and the publication stage, when the editorial team will ask for the raw <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">.tex</code> so that they could render it and later provide page proofs. The next line <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">fig&#95;caption: true</code> tells R Markdown to make sure that whatever images are included in the document are treated as figures in which our caption in brackets in a Markdown call is treated as the caption in the figure. The next line (<code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">latex&#95;engine: pdflatex</code>) tells R Markdown to use pdflatex and not some other option like <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">lualatex</code>. For my template, I'm pretty sure this is mandatory.[^pdflatex]

[^natbib]: R Markdown can use Pandoc's native bibliography management system or even <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">biblatex</code>, but I've found that it chokes with some of the more advanced stuff I've done with my .bib file over the years. For example, I've been diligent about special characters (e.g. umlauts and acute accents) in author names in my .bib file, but Pandoc's native citation system will choke on these characters in a .bib file. I effectively need <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">natbib</code> for my own projects.
[^pdflatex]: The main reason I still use <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">pdflatex</code> (and most readers probably do as well) is because of LaTeX fonts. [Unlike others](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~aty/bibliog/latex/gripe.html), I find standard LaTeX fonts to be appealing.

The next line (<code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">template: ...</code>) tells R Markdown to use my custom LaTeX template.<a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates" target="_blank">^path] While I will own any errors in the code, I confess to "Frankensteining" this template from [the default LaTeX template</a> from Pandoc, <a href="https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates/tree/master/templates" target="_blank">Kieran Healy's LaTeX template</a>, and liberally using raw TeX from the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/acm-latex-style-guide" target="_blank">Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) LaTeX template</a>. I rather like that template since it resembles standard manuscripts when they are published in some of our more prominent journals. I will continue with a description of the YAML metadata in the next paragraph, though invite the curious reader to scroll to the end of the accompanying post to see the PDF this template produces.


[^path]: Notice that the path is relative. The user can, if she wishes, install this in the default Pandoc directory. I don't think this is necessary. Just be mindful of wherever the template is placed. Importantly, <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">~</code> is used in R to find the home directory (not necessarily the working directory). It is equivalent to saying <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">/home/steve</code> in Linux, or <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">/Users/steve</code> on a Mac, in my case.

The next fields get to the heart of the document itself. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">title:</code> is, intuitively, the title of the manuscript. Do note that fields like <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">title:</code> do not have to be in quotation marks, but must be in quotation marks if the title of the document includes a colon. That said, the only reason to use a colon in an article title is if it is followed by a subtitle, hence the optional field (<code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">subtitle:</code>). Notice I "comment out" the subtitle in the above example with a pound sign since this particular document does not have a subtitle. If <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">thanks:</code> is included and has an accompanying entry, the ensuing title of the document gets an asterisk and a footnote. This field is typically used to advise readers that the document is a working paper or is forthcoming in a journal.

The next field (<code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">author:</code>) is a divergence from standard YAML, but I think it is useful. I will also confess to pilfering this idea from Kieran Healy's template. Typically, multiple authors for a given document are separated by an <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">\and</code> in this field. However, standard LaTeX then creates a tabular field separating multiple authors that is somewhat restrictive and not easy to override. As a result, I use this setup (again, taken from Kieran Healy) to sidestep the restrictive rendering of authors in the standard <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">\maketitle</code> tag. After <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">author:</code>, enter <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">&#45; name:</code> (no space before the dash) and fill in the field with the first author. On the next line, enter two spaces, followed by <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">affiliation:</code> and the institute or university affiliation of the first author.

Do notice this can be repeated for however many co-authors there are to a manuscript. The rendered PDF will enter each co-author in a new line in a manner similar to journals like <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>American Political Science Review</i>, or <i>Journal of Politics</i>.

The next two fields pertain to the frontmatter of a manuscript. They should also be intuitive for the reader. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">abstract</code> should contain the abstract and <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">keywords</code> should contain some keywords that describe the research project. Both fields are optional, though are practically mandatory. Every manuscript requires an abstract and some journals---especially those published by Sage---request them with submitted manuscripts. My template also includes these keywords in the PDF's metadata.

<code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">date</code> comes standard with R Markdown and you can use it to enter the date of the most recent compile. I typically include the date of the last compile for a working paper in the <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">thanks:</code> field, so this field currently does not do anything in my Markdown-LaTeX manuscript template. I include it in my YAML as a legacy, basically.

The next items are optional and cosmetic. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">geometry:</code> is a standard option in LaTeX. I set the margins at one inch, and you probably should too. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">fontfamily:</code> is optional, but I use it to specify the Palatino font. The default option is Computer Modern Roman. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">fontsize:</code> sets, intuitively, the font size. The default is 10-point, but I prefer 11-point. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">spacing:</code> is an optional field. If it is set as "double", the ensuing document is double-spaced. "single" is the only other valid entry for this field, though not including the entry in the YAML metadata amounts to singlespacing the document by default. Notice I have this "commented out" in the example code.

The final two options pertain to the bibliography. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">bibliography:</code> specifies the location of the .bib file, so the author could make citations in the manuscript. <code class="vue-simple-markdown__inline-code">biblio&#45;style</code> specifies the type of bibliography to use. You'll typically set this as APSR. You could also specify the relative path of <a href="http://svmiller.com/miscellany/journal-of-peace-research-bst-file/" target="_blank">my <i>Journal of Peace Research</i> .bst file</a> if you are submitting to that journal.

<h1>Getting Started with Markdown Syntax</h1>

There are a lot of cheatsheets and reference guides for Markdown (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">Adam Prichard</a>, <a href="http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html" target="_blank">Assemble</a>, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Rstudio</a>, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf" target="_blank">Rstudio again</a>, <a href="http://scottboms.com/downloads/documentation/markdown_cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Scott Boms</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a>, among, I'm sure, several others). I encourage the reader to look at those, though I will retread these references here with a minimal working example below.

[Unlike others](http:\u002F\u002Fwww-rohan.sdsu.edu\u002F~aty\u002Fbibliog\u002Flatex\u002Fgripe.html), I find standard LaTeX fonts to be appealing.\n\nThe next line (`template: ...`) tells R Markdown to use my custom LaTeX template.[^path] While I will own any errors in the code, I confess to \"Frankensteining\" this template from [the default LaTeX template](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjgm\u002Fpandoc-templates) from Pandoc, [Kieran Healy's LaTeX template](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fkjhealy\u002Fpandoc-templates\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Ftemplates), and liberally using raw TeX from the [Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) LaTeX template](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.acm.org\u002Fpublications\u002Farticle-templates\u002Facm-latex-style-guide). I rather like that template since it resembles standard manuscripts when they are published in some of our more prominent journals. I will continue with a description of the YAML metadata in the next paragraph, though invite the curious reader to scroll to the end of the accompanying post to see the PDF this template produces.\n\n\n[^path]: Notice that the path is relative. The user can, if she wishes, install this in the default Pandoc directory. I don't think this is necessary. Just be mindful of wherever the template is placed. Importantly, `~` is used in R to find the home directory (not necessarily the working directory). It is equivalent to saying `\u002Fhome\u002Fsteve` in Linux, or `\u002FUsers\u002Fsteve` on a Mac, in my case.\n\nThe next fields get to the heart of the document itself. `title:` is, intuitively, the title of the manuscript. Do note that fields like `title:` do not have to be in quotation marks, but must be in quotation marks if the title of the document includes a colon. That said, the only reason to use a colon in an article title is if it is followed by a subtitle, hence the optional field (`subtitle:`). Notice I \"comment out\" the subtitle in the above example with a pound sign since this particular document does not have a subtitle. If `thanks:` is included and has an accompanying entry, the ensuing title of the document gets an asterisk and a footnote. This field is typically used to advise readers that the document is a working paper or is forthcoming in a journal.\n\nThe next field (`author:`) is a divergence from standard YAML, but I think it is useful. I will also confess to pilfering this idea from Kieran Healy's template. Typically, multiple authors for a given document are separated by an `\\and` in this field. However, standard LaTeX then creates a tabular field separating multiple authors that is somewhat restrictive and not easy to override. As a result, I use this setup (again, taken from Kieran Healy) to sidestep the restrictive rendering of authors in the standard `\\maketitle` tag. After `author:`, enter `- name:` (no space before the dash) and fill in the field with the first author. On the next line, enter two spaces, followed by `affiliation:` and the institute or university affiliation of the first author.\n\nDo notice this can be repeated for however many co-authors there are to a manuscript. The rendered PDF will enter each co-author in a new line in a manner similar to journals like *American Journal of Political Science*, *American Political Science Review*, or *Journal of Politics*.\n\nThe next two fields pertain to the frontmatter of a manuscript. They should also be intuitive for the reader. `abstract` should contain the abstract and `keywords` should contain some keywords that describe the research project. Both fields are optional, though are practically mandatory. Every manuscript requires an abstract and some journals---especially those published by Sage---request them with submitted manuscripts. My template also includes these keywords in the PDF's metadata.\n\n`date` comes standard with R Markdown and you can use it to enter the date of the most recent compile. I typically include the date of the last compile for a working paper in the `thanks:` field, so this field currently does not do anything in my Markdown-LaTeX manuscript template. I include it in my YAML as a legacy, basically.\n\nThe next items are optional and cosmetic. `geometry:` is a standard option in LaTeX. I set the margins at one inch, and you probably should too. `fontfamily:` is optional, but I use it to specify the Palatino font. The default option is Computer Modern Roman. `fontsize:` sets, intuitively, the font size. The default is 10-point, but I prefer 11-point. `spacing:` is an optional field. If it is set as \"double\", the ensuing document is double-spaced. \"single\" is the only other valid entry for this field, though not including the entry in the YAML metadata amounts to singlespacing the document by default. Notice I have this \"commented out\" in the example code.\n\nThe final two options pertain to the bibliography. `bibliography:` specifies the location of the .bib file, so the author could make citations in the manuscript. `biblio-style` specifies the type of bibliography to use. You'll typically set this as APSR. You could also specify the relative path of [my *Journal of Peace Research* .bst file](http:\u002F\u002Fsvmiller.com\u002Fmiscellany\u002Fjournal-of-peace-research-bst-file\u002F) if you are submitting to that journal.\n\n# Getting Started with Markdown Syntax\n\nThere are a lot of cheatsheets and reference guides for Markdown (e.g. [Adam Prichard](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fadam-p\u002Fmarkdown-here\u002Fwiki\u002FMarkdown-Cheatsheet), [Assemble](http:\u002F\u002Fassemble.io\u002Fdocs\u002FCheatsheet-Markdown.html), [Rstudio](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.rstudio.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2015\u002F02\u002Frmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf), [Rstudio again](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.rstudio.com\u002Fwp-content\u002Fuploads\u002F2015\u002F03\u002Frmarkdown-reference.pdf), [Scott Boms](http:\u002F\u002Fscottboms.com\u002Fdownloads\u002Fdocumentation\u002Fmarkdown_cheatsheet.pdf), [Daring Fireball](https:\u002F\u002Fdaringfireball.net\u002Fprojects\u002Fmarkdown\u002Fsyntax), among, I'm sure, several others). I encourage the reader to look at those, though I will retread these references here with a minimal working example below.\n\n```markdown\n\n# Introduction\n\n**Lorem ipsum** dolor *sit amet*. \n\n- Single asterisks italicize text *like this*. \n- Double asterisks embolden text **like this**.\n\nStart a new paragraph with a blank line separating paragraphs.\n\n- This will start an unordered list environment, and this will be the first item.\n- This will be a second item.\n- A third item.\n    - Four spaces and a dash create a sublist and this item in it.\n- The fourth item.\n    \n1.
